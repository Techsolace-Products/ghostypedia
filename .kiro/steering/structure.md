# Project Structure

## Current Organization

Ghostypedia is a fresh repository, and the project structure will be defined as development progresses.  
As new directories, modules, and components are introduced, this section will be updated to reflect the evolving architecture.

## Conventions

Conventions will be established based on the chosen tech stack and architectural decisions.  
These may include naming standards, folder organization rules, component structure guidelines, and coding patterns.  
Details will be added here once the stack is finalized.

## Notes

- Update this document as folders and modules are created  
- Document the purpose of each major directory  
- Include any naming conventions or organizational patterns  
- Treat this document as the reference point for contributors and maintainers
